# Sidenotes Demonstration

Sidenotes are a key feature of the Tufte CSS system, allowing for elegant annotations that don't interrupt the flow of reading[^basic].

## Basic Sidenotes

Edward Tufte's approach to sidenotes revolutionized academic writing[^second]. Unlike traditional footnotes that require the reader to jump to the bottom of the page, sidenotes maintain visual connection with the referenced text[^third].

## Multiple Sidenotes

When multiple sidenotes appear in close proximity[^close], the layout system automatically adjusts spacing[^closer] to prevent overlap[^closest].

## Longer Sidenotes

Sometimes sidenotes contain more substantial content[^long].

The main text continues to flow naturally, uninterrupted by the presence of the extended sidenote in the margin.

## Sidenotes with Formatting

Sidenotes can include basic formatting[^formatted].

## Academic Citations

In academic writing, sidenotes often contain citations[^citation1] that would traditionally appear as footnotes. The Tufte system makes these references more accessible and less disruptive to the reading experience.In academic writing, sidenotes often contain citations[^citation2] that would traditionally appear as footnotes.

[^basic]: This is a sidenote. It appears in the margin and provides additional context without breaking the reader's concentration.
[^second]: Tufte, Edward R. *Beautiful Evidence*. Graphics Press, 2006.
[^third]: This connection is both spatial and cognitive, reducing the reading burden.
[^close]: Like this one.
[^closer]: And this one follows naturally.
[^closest]: And this one as well.
[^long]: This is an example of a longer sidenote that contains multiple sentences. It might include a brief explanation of a concept, a tangential thought that adds depth to the main text, or even a short quotation. The Tufte CSS system handles these gracefully by allowing the sidenote to extend vertically as needed while maintaining proper alignment with the main text.
[^formatted]: **Bold text**, *italic text*, and even `code snippets` work within sidenotes. This allows for rich annotations that maintain typographic consistency with the main document.
