# Blockquote Demonstration

Blockquotes in Tufte CSS maintain the elegant, readable style that characterizes the entire system.

## Basic Blockquotes

> The English language is a work in progress. Have fun with it.
> <cite>Jonathan Culver</cite>

Simple blockquotes like this one demonstrate the clean typography and appropriate spacing that makes quoted material stand out without overwhelming the page design.

## Extended Blockquotes

> We are drowning in information and starving for knowledge. The good news is that the research shows us how to transform information into knowledge. We need to slow down, synthesize, and take time to turn information into insight.
> 
> The goal is not to consume more information, but to think more deeply about the information we already have.
> 
> <cite>Cal Newport, *Digital Minimalism*</cite>

Longer blockquotes spanning multiple paragraphs maintain proper spacing and indentation throughout.

## Blockquotes with Citations

> Typography is the craft of endowing human language with a durable visual form, and thus with an independent existence. Its heartwood is calligraphythe dance, on a tiny stage, of the living, speaking handand its roots reach into living soil, though its branches may be hung each year with new machines.

> <cite>Bringhurst, *The Elements of Typographic Style*</cite>

## Blockquotes in Context

The surrounding text flows naturally around blockquotes[^sidenote], maintaining the document's rhythm and readability.

> The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them.
> <cite>Ernest Hemingway</cite>

The integration of blockquotes with margin notes[^mn-integration] demonstrates the flexibility of the Tufte CSS system.

[^sidenote]: This demonstrates how sidenotes work alongside blockquotes.
[^mn-integration]: Margin notes can provide additional context for quoted material without interrupting the visual flow.
