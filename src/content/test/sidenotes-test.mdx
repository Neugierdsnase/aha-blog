# Sidenotes Demonstration

Sidenotes are a key feature of the Tufte CSS system, allowing for elegant annotations that don't interrupt the flow of reading^[This is a sidenote. It appears in the margin and provides additional context without breaking the reader's concentration.].

## Basic Sidenotes

Edward Tufte's approach to sidenotes revolutionized academic writing^[Tufte, Edward R. *Beautiful Evidence*. Graphics Press, 2006.]. Unlike traditional footnotes that require the reader to jump to the bottom of the page, sidenotes maintain visual connection with the referenced text^[This connection is both spatial and cognitive, reducing the reading burden.].

## Multiple Sidenotes

When multiple sidenotes appear in close proximity^[Like this one.], the layout system automatically adjusts spacing^[And this one follows naturally.] to prevent overlap^[The third sidenote demonstrates proper vertical spacing.].

## Longer Sidenotes

Sometimes sidenotes contain more substantial content^[This is an example of a longer sidenote that contains multiple sentences. It might include a brief explanation of a concept, a tangential thought that adds depth to the main text, or even a short quotation. The Tufte CSS system handles these gracefully by allowing the sidenote to extend vertically as needed while maintaining proper alignment with the main text.].

The main text continues to flow naturally, uninterrupted by the presence of the extended sidenote in the margin.

## Sidenotes with Formatting

Sidenotes can include basic formatting^[**Bold text**, *italic text*, and even `code snippets` work within sidenotes. This allows for rich annotations that maintain typographic consistency with the main document.].

## Academic Citations

In academic writing, sidenotes often contain citations^[Smith, John. "The Art of Margin Notes." *Journal of Typography*, vol. 42, no. 3, 2023, pp. 15-32.] that would traditionally appear as footnotes. The Tufte system makes these references more accessible and less disruptive to the reading experience.
