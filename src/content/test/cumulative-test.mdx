# Comprehensive Tufte CSS Feature Test

This document demonstrates how all the various Tufte CSS elements work together in a cohesive design system^[comprehensive-note: This test combines sidenotes, margin notes, blockquotes, and epigraphs to show their integration.].

## Typography and Layout

The foundation of Tufte CSS is its typography^[mn-typography: Based on Edward Tufte's design principles, emphasizing clarity and elegance.]. The system uses ET Book, a font inspired by Bembo, which provides excellent readability at various sizes.

> Typography is two-dimensional architecture, based on experience and imagination, and guided by rules and readability.
>  Hermann Zapf

The integration of text and marginal elements creates a reading experience that feels both scholarly and accessible^[accessibility-note: Despite its academic origins, Tufte CSS remains highly readable on various devices and screen sizes.].

## Visual Elements and Annotations

When combining different annotation types^[mn-visual: Visual hierarchy becomes crucial when multiple element types appear together.], the layout system must handle spacing intelligently. Consider this passage with multiple marginal elements:

The original Tufte CSS was created by Dave Liepmann^[dave-liepmann: Dave Liepmann created the original CSS implementation of Tufte's design principles in 2015.] as a way to bring Edward Tufte's design philosophy to the web^[mn-web: The transition from print to web required careful consideration of responsive design principles.].

> CSS is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page.
> 
> Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, and much more.

## Complex Integrations

The epigraph above illustrates how these elements can appear mid-document^[mid-document: Epigraphs aren't limited to document beginningsthey can introduce new sections effectively.]. This flexibility allows authors to structure their content with visual breaks and thematic introductions.

### Nested Structures

Sometimes complex documents require nested annotations^[nested-primary: This is the primary annotation for this section.]:

- Lists work naturally with the system^[mn-lists: Both ordered and unordered lists maintain proper spacing and alignment.]
- Margin notes can reference list items^[mn-list-reference: This margin note specifically discusses the list structure.]
- Multiple annotation types coexist^[coexistence-note: The key is maintaining visual balance and preventing cognitive overload.]

## Conclusion

The power of the Tufte CSS system lies not in any single element, but in how all components work together to create a cohesive reading experience^[mn-conclusion: This comprehensive test demonstrates the system's flexibility and elegance when all features are used together.]. The careful balance between main content and marginal annotations allows for rich, layered documents that remain readable and visually appealing^[final-note: Edward Tufte's influence on information design continues to shape how we think about presenting complex information.].
