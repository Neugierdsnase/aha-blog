import Epigraph from "../../components/Epigraph.astro";

<Epigraph
  quote="The limits of my language mean the limits of my world."
  footer='<cite> Ludwig Wittgenstein, <em>Tractus Logico-Philosophicus</em></cite>'
/>

# Epigraph Component Demonstration

The epigraph above sets the tone for this demonstration of how epigraphs function within the Tufte CSS system. Epigraphs serve as thematic introductions, providing context or inspiration for the content that follows.

## Multiple Epigraphs

<Epigraph
  quote="I have made this longer than usual because I have not had time to make it shorter."
  footer='<cite> Blaise Pascal</cite>'
/>

Sometimes a section benefits from its own epigraph, as shown above. The Pascal quote speaks to the craft of writing itselfthe paradox that brevity requires more effort than verbosity.

## Formatting Variations

<Epigraph
  quote="In typography, as in architecture, the proportions must be not just pleasing, but essential to the design's function."
  footer='<cite> Jan Tschichold, <em>The New Typography</em></cite>'
/>

This epigraph demonstrates how longer quotations are handled, maintaining proper line breaks and spacing while preserving the distinctive epigraph styling.

## Literary Epigraphs

<Epigraph
  quote="It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness..."
  footer='<cite> Charles Dickens, <em>A Tale of Two Cities</em></cite>'
/>

Classic literary openings make excellent epigraphs^[classic-literature: The opening of *A Tale of Two Cities* is one of the most recognizable in English literature.], establishing mood and connecting contemporary work to literary tradition.

## Technical Considerations

The Epigraph component handles proper attribution formatting^[mn-attribution: Notice how the attribution is styled differently from the main quote, using proper citation formatting.], ensuring that sources are clearly identified while maintaining visual hierarchy.

<Epigraph
  quote="Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."
  footer='<cite> Leonardo da Vinci</cite>'
/>

This principle of simplicity guides both the design of the Tufte CSS system and the implementation of components like the Epigraph.
